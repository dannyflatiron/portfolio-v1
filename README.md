# Portfolio

My portfolio website showcasing some of my projects. I used this app to explore some frameworks that I wanted to try out such as anime.js and D3.js. I also took some time to learn how to setup webhooks to automate pushing changes to prod. This forced me to adopt the mindframe of staging my commits in a testing environment and then psuhing those commits to my main branch. Also, this project helped me immensly in refining my CSS skills and working in vanilla JS was surprisingly a breath of fresh air. I am looking forward towards more improvements such as creating a database where I can store files or focusing on dev ops. [Live site](https://dannyreina.com).
